In August 2014 we also won a $50,000 grant from the state of Virginia&#39;s Commonwealth Research and Commercialization Fund. We&#39;re not charging our users anything during this trial phase, but we&#39;d like to do so (very) soon.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re currently in the middle of a pilot with a few hundred brave customers. In total, they&#39;re sending us about 1,250,000 data points per day across a number of connected Twitter, Shopify, Facebook, and Google Analytics accounts. At the moment, we can effectively use only a fraction of that data. We need to make the interface we expose to users more usable before we can do some of the things we want to do.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s where you come in.</p>\n\n<h1>About the role</h1>\n\n<p>We&#39;re looking for a <strong>front-end designer</strong> to help us build this platform. We&#39;re looking for someone who has a passion for software development, loves making things work well, and who thrives in a high-impact, low-ceremony startup environment.</p>\n\n<p>In general, you would be responsible for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>designing and building component-based, reusable, modular designs for web, mobile, and e-mail user-agents</li>\n<li>constructing new components and helping us solve difficult design problems</li>\n<li>presenting information in a clear, effective, and straightforward way</li>\n<li>writing SCSS, Haml, and very occasionally JavaScript</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The initial project is to redesign our prototype administrative backend and to develop a design vocabulary of components we can use in other contexts on our site. From there, we&#39;d like to work further with you on a number of other projects -- designing new interfaces for features we want to build, implementing ways of showing large amounts of relevant information, and others in the pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>This is a contract position that pays US$450 per day. Generally we&#39;d expect you to work 2-3 weekdays per week and to have some time overlap with US ET (UTC-4/-5), but we otherwise care much more about the results you deliver than the hours you spend. We prefer that people work when they want to, not when a clock tells them to, so you don&#39;t need to keep track of your time other than to tell us how many days you worked in a particular week.</p>\n\n<h1>Our technology</h1>\n\n<p>We generally place a high premium on architectural and code simplicity, and try to minimize complexity at all levels.</p>\n\n<p>Our styles are a small custom theme built on top of Bootstrap 3 and Flatty, written in SCSS; the pages are in Haml and pipelines to HTML. JS usage is minimal; individual pages are largely static and an emphasis is on quick loads.</p>\n\n<p>We run a <a href=\"https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework\">Padrino</a> stack on Cloud66 and DigitalOcean. ActiveRecord 4 is used for the small number of models that interact with the database directly. The datastore is <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">Postgresql 9.3</a>; we also use <a href=\"http://redis.io/\">Redis</a> to store jobs for Resque.</p>\n\n<p>The architecture is likewise fairly simple: there&#39;s one load balancer, two web servers, one process server, and one Postgresql database. Our codebase is small right now, clocking in at around 1,500 lines including all models, controllers, and services.</p>\n\n<p>You can run all the tests (RSpec and Rubocop) with a single command, and you can deploy to production or any other environment with a single command.</p>\n\n<h1>About you</h1>\n\n<p>You:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>are comfortable working with a remote team</li>\n<li>are comfortable using tools like Google Hangout and Flowdock to collaborate with teammates</li>\n<li>enjoy one of <a href=\"http://xkcd.com\">XKCD</a>, <a href=\"http://smbc-comics.com\">SMBC</a>, <a href=\"http://modelviewculture.com/\">Model View Culture</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.pbfcomics.com/archive_b/PBF081-Q.P._Inc..gif\">PBF</a></li>\n<li>are a fan of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#x27;t_repeat_yourself\">DRY</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#The_Simplest_Thing_that_Could_Possibly_Work\">STTCPW</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain%27t_Gonna_Need_It\">YAGNI</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your technical experience includes most or all of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>proficiency with SCSS, Haml, CSS3, and JavaScript</li>\n<li>fluency and experience with writing modular, composable, reusable (S)CSS</li>\n<li>ability to leverage your design experience in the context of an information-heavy application</li>\n<li>constructing interactive components, controls, or interface elements</li>\n<li>you understand and can use git to make commits on topic branches</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bonus points if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>you can point to public commits you&#39;ve made on a project you like</li>\n<li>you have written an interesting technical blog post, essay, rant, etc. that you can link to</li>\n<li>you have worked at a startup before</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>How to apply</h1>\n\n<p>If you think you&#39;d be a good fit, we&#39;d love to hear from you!

But it also means that we need to diligently manage technical complexity, as each system works in a slightly different way, with its own features and quirks. SOAP is (unfortunately) used by many APIs, which is why we released our open source library, <a href=\"https://github.com/loco2/lolsoap\">LolSoap</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the most difficult challenges we face relate to routing and making sense of lots of data. Which routes are best to get from A to B? Which booking systems should be queried?

The challenges faced by City residents are often complex and multi-faceted, cutting across the responsibilities of individual agencies. Connect builds tools and processes that help agencies understand their clients\u2019 circumstances, needs, and interactions with the City more comprehensively. Connect also designs and builds client-facing applications to help residents access information, benefits and support directly.</p>\n\n<p>The first generation of Connect\u2019s products include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ACCESS NYC, a website that allows New Yorkers to screen for eligibility for over 30 City, State, and Federal benefit programs.  Depending on the benefit, residents can apply online, print out pre-populated application forms, and determine agency locations where they can go to directly apply for services.</li>\n<li>Worker Connect, a data sharing technology that allows case workers to see real-time information about clients drawn from multiple City sources.  Users only access information that they have been authorized to view based on their role and all applicable laws and regulations.</li>\n<li>Enterprise Case Management, a software platform that helps agencies track the progress of their clients.  Connect staff provide strategic guidance to agencies seeking to develop new case management systems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Going forward, Connect will enhance these existing tools while growing its portfolio of products and services. As technology becomes more advanced and ubiquitous, solutions can be increasingly more personalized, analytical, adaptive, and scalable. Connect\u2019s mandate is to harness these possibilities and create new digital applications that advance greater equality and opportunity in New York City. </p>\n\n<p>JOB DESCRIPTION:</p>\n\n<p>The Senior Java Developer will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Manage the development lifecycle for the Document Management Solution, comprising a federated model and partner agency implementations of FileNet repositories. </li>\n<li>Administer FileNet components including application and system monitoring across all environments.</li>\n<li>Develop solutions using FileNet P8 APIs and J2EE standards and maintain current software. </li>\n<li>Work with product service providers to open PMR\u2019s and assist in troubleshooting and resolving problems in FileNet P8 applications.</li>\n<li>Install/upgrade FileNet P8 components, patches and bug fixes.</li>\n<li>Create and update technical design specifications, design and implement application enhancements, build and deploy the code. </li>\n<li>Develop/update ANT scripts for deployment. </li>\n<li>Assist in setting up build environments.</li>\n<li>Identify the tasks and provide the level of effort to complete the tasks.</li>\n<li>Contribute to new technology projects as assigned and provide operations &amp; maintenance support for existing Document Management Applications. </li>\n<li>Maintain FileNet API and custom code used by FileNet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>PREFERRED SKILLS:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bachelor\u2019s degree in a related IT field. </li>\n<li>3-5 years of experience with Java/J2EE, XML/XSLT, Web services, AJAX, Java script, Apache ANT. </li>\n<li>Hands on experience developing and architecting web services interfaces using Java/J2EE with a preference for experience working with IBM File Net document management and workflow systems.</li>\n<li>Basic knowledge about key components of an IBM FileNet P8 system and their functions will be huge plus.</li>\n<li>A good understanding of workflow management systems for defining a simple workflow, creating work queues and monitoring work queues is highly desirable but not necessary.</li>\n<li>Familiarity with content engine Java API library for creating custom applications for an IBM FileNet P8 Content Manager system.</li>\n<li>Individuals must be self-motivated to learn new technologies and possess excellent verbal and written communication skills.</li>\n<li>Experience working with the team responsible for delivering Enterprise Applications that integrates with ECM software.</li>\n<li>Experience using software configuration management tools such as Rational Clear Case, Subversion. </li>\n<li>Demonstrated experience working with technical and non-technical staff and ability to work well on cross-functional project teams.</li>\n<li>Must be able to talk to non-technical business clients in being able to clarify functional requirements. </li>\n<li>Excellent analytical, organization, presentation and facilitation skills; ability to handle multiple tasks under tight deadlines. </li>\n<li>Ability to interface with executive level management.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Qualification Requirements\n1.

You should have an informed opinion on the Article 29 Working Party, for instance. FedRAMP, SOC, and ISO are letters that don&#39;t mean much to most, but should be important, ideally even interesting, to you. Experience with privacy and various other federal, state and international compliance/regulatory schemes.</li>\n<li>A passion for Intellectual Property and Internet Policy. </li>\n<li>Taking joy and excelling in the written word. </li>\n<li>An ability to thrive in an environment in which you need to acquire buy-in, mobilize and lead processes collaboratively.</li>\n<li>A lights-out academic background with 4 to 7 years of post-J.D. experience might work, but the overwhelming preference is for someone who has previously built and implemented successful privacy systems within a software company and faced cloud computing challenges first-hand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>CIPP certification is a plus, as is very basic technical coding experience (all GitHubbers end up needing to be able to write in basic Markdown, for instance). </p>\n\n<h5>Application requirements</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A cover letter is required.

A CS background or degree usually helps a lot, but is not a strict requirement if you really know your stuff.</p>\n\n<h2>Our Tech </h2>\n\n<p>At our core, we are a team of great engineers from world-class companies, so we take our tech very seriously. We work to improve our tools and approaches every day -- whether pushing the envelope with automated unit-tests or writing a super-optimized data analysis framework. We don&#39;t over-engineer and also don&#39;t under-engineer -- just the right tool for the job.</p>\n\n<p>We take great pride in our code because we all want to innovate quickly. We build everything from Android software to C++ image recognition, from web UI to pedometer data analysis. Our apps operate off-line, and we have built lots of client-side infrastructure to lazily load and sync data with the server. This allows us to keep the server side relatively simple while still serving millions of users: Spring/Flask, Spring MVC, mySQL/Mongo.</p>\n\n<p>We run Hadoop-based machine learning to find out what makes people stick to habits, create online clustering algorithms to match people to their ideal support group, serve millions of users with many terabytes of data, and tackle many difficult challenges ( <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Noom-company/What-are-some-of-the-engineering-challenges-at-Noom\">http://www.quora.com/Noom-company/What-are-some-of-the-engineering-challenges-at-Noom</a> ) every day. Because we are small dev team (17 strong), working at Noom gives you the unique opportunity to both use what we have created and build many more foundational technologies.</p>\n\n<h2>Our Culture </h2>\n\n<p>We have worked hard to build an awesome companyculture ( <a href=\"http://www.noom.com/culture.php\">http://www.noom.com/culture.php</a> ), stealing a bit from Google (many of us are ex-Googlers) and improving on it to become one ofCrain\u2019s \u201cBest Places to Work in NYC 2013\u201d ( <a href=\"http://www.crainsnewyork.com/gallery/20131206/FEATURES/120909999/64\">http://www.crainsnewyork.com/gallery/20131206/FEATURES/120909999/64</a> )</p>\n\n<p>Our tech team works with a ton of interesting Noomers and advisers, including our in-house psychologist as well as fitness experts, physicians and researchers. We test our prototypes on sample users, averaging 2 user-tests a day, so you\u2019ll be able to see how real people react to your work and iterate. So unlike most tech companies, you\u2019ll interact with a diverse network of people. After all, we are team of problem solvers, always interested in learning and growing.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about being pigeonholed, fear not. You\u2019ll get to choose a mission (usually for 4 - 6 months) and work on the projects you\u2019re interested in. We also have frequent company-wide hackathons. Everyone on the team is a generalist -- we explore new frameworks, and learn them quickly. We like to learn.</p>\n\n<p>We are now ready to double the size of our engineering team with some incredible engineers (read on below!).</p>\n\n<h2>Our Company </h2>\n\n<p>Noom is a New York-based health &amp; wellness tech startup that uses mobile technology to help people lead healthier lives (22 million and counting!). While other fitness companies just track, we coach. We learn from the best research in nutrition, psychology and behavior modification and combine it with the latest tech to design next-generation health &amp; wellness apps on Android and iOS.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve built a strong foundation with hundreds of thousands of paying customers, a grant from the National Institutes of Health, $7M in Series A funding led by RRE Ventures and a team of 40 full-time Noomers -- 30 in our NYC headquarters and 10 in our foreign offices (Seoul and Berlin).</p>\n\n<p>But we need your help -- read on if you think you\u2019ve got the stuff.</p>\n\n<h2>Our Products </h2>\n\n<p>At Noom we tackle some of the world\u2019s biggest problems -- obesity, diabetes and heart disease. We believe the best way to do this is by focusing on nutrition (TechCrunch ( <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/22/health-startup-noom-receives-nih-grant-to-study-smartphone-tech-in-eating-disorder-treatment/\">http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/22/health-startup-noom-receives-nih-grant-to-study-smartphone-tech-in-eating-disorder-treatment/</a> )) and fitness (GigaOm ( <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/06/11/nooms-android-fitness-app-another-example-of-why-smartphones-are-the-original-wearable-computers/\">http://gigaom.com/2013/06/11/nooms-android-fitness-app-another-example-of-why-smartphones-are-the-original-wearable-computers/</a> )). More than just counting calories, our mobile software applications offer intelligent, scientifically-backed, customized nutrition- and exercise-coaching designed to impact habits and behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Our flagship app, Noom Weight Loss Coach, has been the #1 top grossing health &amp; fitness application since 2012. It achieves the best outcomes in the industry with over 10 pounds lost per paid member. How, you ask? Great question! It has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A coaching engine that generates personalized daily tasks &amp; realtime motivational feedback;</p></li>\n<li><p>The world\u2019s most accurate food database, crowd-sourced by users &amp; instantly searchable;</p></li>\n<li><p>Virtual support groups created using automated clustering technology and tracked using scalable management tools.</p></li>\n<li><p>A focus on simplicity and friendliness, to make all of the above easy to use</p></li>\n<li><p>Many more features focused around guidance &amp; motivation for our users</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Our Benefits </h2>\n\n<p>If you want to learn how a startup really works on the inside, then Noom is the place for you. We have an incredible amount of transparency, with weekly all-company TGIFs where the wine and the information both flow freely (much to our legal counsel\u2019s dismay). Because you\u2019ll have equity in the company and have to make many decisions in your work, it\u2019s important for you to know what\u2019s going on.</p>\n\n<p>We have an amazing chef (we love her!) who prepares gourmet lunches every day for all employees (along with afternoon smoothies and random breakfasts and dinners), a lively office with frequent visitors, and a dedicated team who work hard and play hard, with frequent offsites (beach, anyone?) and team outings (from shuffleboard to wine tasting).
